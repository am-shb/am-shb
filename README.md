### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Amir, a skilled artificial intelligence and machine learning enthusiast with a passion for technology. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science with AI Specialization and previous working experience in multiple roles such as Software Engineer, Teaching Assistant, and Research Assistant. Currently I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Canada Revenue Agency. Don't forget to visit my website at [shahbandegan.me](https://shahbandegan.me). You will find lots of cool stuff!

**I am actively looking for full time opportunites as a ML Engineer or Data Scientist. If you have any opportunites within your team, please contact me.**
